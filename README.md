# Troubleshooting Script

This script helps troubleshoot network connectivity and VPN connections on a user's VM.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hackthebox/Troubleshooting
cd Troubleshooting
```

Run the script without any arguments to perform the standard set of tests:
```sh
sudo ./check.sh 
```


Run the script with a target IP to also ping your target along with the default tests:
```sh
sudo ./check.sh 10.10.10.11
```

This will save the logs to `output.log` in the same working directory.
